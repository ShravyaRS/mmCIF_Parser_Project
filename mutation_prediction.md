# 🧬 Disease Mutation Prediction

## 🔍 TPH1 Mutations

While TPH1 mutations are rare, some have been associated with:

- **Autism spectrum disorders**
- **Mood disorders**
- **Aggression-related phenotypes**

Key Variants:
- rs1800532 (promoter polymorphism)
- Potential effect: altered serotonin levels.

## 🧬 PAH Mutations and Phenylketonuria (PKU)

PAH gene mutations lead to PKU. Common mutations include:

| Variant        | Mutation Type    | Effect                          |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| R408W          | Missense         | Severely reduced enzyme activity |
| Y414C          | Missense         | Affects protein folding         |
| IVS12+1G>A     | Splice-site      | Aberrant mRNA splicing          |

> 📌 **PKU Incidence**: 1 in 10,000 births (approx.)

## 🧠 Prediction Tools You Can Use

- **PolyPhen-2**: Predicts impact of amino acid substitutions
- **SIFT**: Predicts whether a substitution affects protein function
- **MutPred**: Predicts pathogenicity of protein variants
