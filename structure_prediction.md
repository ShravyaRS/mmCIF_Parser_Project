#  Structure Prediction and Modeling

##  Tools for Structure Modeling

- **AlphaFold**: Provides predicted protein structures using AI
- **SWISS-MODEL**: Template-based modeling
- **I-TASSER**: Threading-based prediction
- **PyMOL/Chimera**: Structure visualization tools

##  Example: Predicting Structure of TPH1 Variant

Using AlphaFold, we can model the 3D conformation of TPH1 and analyze:

- The **active site** arrangement
- **Structural deviations** caused by mutations
- **Potential binding pockets** for drug design

##  Modeling Workflow

1. Get FASTA sequence from UniProt (e.g., TPH1: [Q8IWU9](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8IWU9))
2. Upload to AlphaFold or I-TASSER
3. Visualize using PyMOL
4. Compare wild-type vs mutant forms

##  Drug Discovery Insight

Structure prediction allows identification of:
- Disease-related mutation hotspots
- Sites for **ligand docking**
- Targets for **precision therapy**
