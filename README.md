# 🧬 mmCIF Parser in Python (No Biopython)

This project demonstrates how to parse mmCIF (Macromolecular Crystallographic Information File) formats **from scratch using Python**. It serves as both an educational resource and a practical tool for molecular biology and structural bioinformatics.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ No external dependencies (not even Biopython!)
- 🧠 Clean object-oriented Python code
- 📊 Extracts atomic-level information from CIF files
- 📁 Supports .cif files from RCSB PDB
- 💡 Perfect for learning how file formats work internally
