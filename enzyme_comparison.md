#  Enzyme Comparison: TPH1 vs PAH

This section explores a comparative analysis between two important human enzymes:

##  Tryptophan Hydroxylase 1 (TPH1)

- **Function:** Catalyzes the hydroxylation of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a precursor of serotonin.
- **Biological Role:** Regulates serotonin biosynthesis, mainly in peripheral tissues like the gut and pineal gland.
- **Gene Location:** Chromosome 11p15.1

##  Phenylalanine Hydroxylase (PAH)

- **Function:** Converts phenylalanine to tyrosine using tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as a cofactor.
- **Biological Role:** Prevents accumulation of phenylalanine, essential in preventing phenylketonuria (PKU).
- **Gene Location:** Chromosome 12q23.2

##  Insights

Despite catalyzing similar hydroxylation reactions, these enzymes differ in substrate specificity and tissue localization. Their mutations have vastly different clinical consequences.
